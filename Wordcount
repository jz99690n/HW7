At the global level population growth is determined by the number of births and deaths.1 
To understand the likely trajectory for population growth we need to examine how births and deaths are changing – and, 
one level deeper, what is happening to those factors which in turn affect them. 
Increasing life expectancy and falling child mortality in every country are of course increasing population numbers. 
The countervailing trend are falling fertility rates – the trend of couples having fewer children is what brought rapid population growth to an end in many countries already, and 
what will bring an end to rapid population growth globally. We are looking at all of these drivers separately.
